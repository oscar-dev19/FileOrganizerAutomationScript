# File Sorter: Automated Downloads Directory Organizer

File Sorter is a versatile and efficient Bash script designed to streamline the process of managing cluttered Downloads directories. This script employs the power of the `inotifywait` command to actively monitor incoming file events. Upon detecting a new file, File Sorter intelligently categorizes it based on its extension, subsequently moving it to an appropriate subdirectory. This automation eliminates the need for manual file sorting and enhances overall productivity.
